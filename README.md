# ManHole
A free and simple management utility for the Pi-Hole. ManHole will display your Pi-Hole stats right in your Windows system tray. You can specify the automatic refresh interval, and you can also quickly enable/disable your Pi-Hole from a right click menu in the tray.

## Known issues
Sometimes the Pi-Hole may become unresponsive, especially if you set auto-refresh too low, or try too quickly to disable/enable the Pi-Hole repeatedly.
